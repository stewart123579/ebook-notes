;;; Commentary:

;; ebook-notes-bibtex are helper functions to identify if a highlight/note is in
;; your BibTeX list. It's pretty rough-and-ready and probably needs more edge
;; cases managed.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Finds if there is an associated BibTeX entry for a clipping
;; - Normalises strings to collapse accented characters to their ASCII
;;   equivalients and strips BibTeX/LaTeX equivalent accenting features
;; - Normalises BibTeX-style LastName, Firstname to Firstname Lastname
